# Rust Study Notes 🎓

Welcome to my Rust programming language learning adventure! 🦀

This repository is where I document my journey of exploring Rust, focusing on web development and web3. As a beginner, my goal is to grow from the basics to mastering Rust at a Senior Developer level. I plan to dedicate 1-3 hours daily after work to achieve this milestone. 💻

## 📖 Books I'm Currently Reading

Here are some books I'm using to deepen my understanding of Rust:

- **[The Rust Programming Language][1]** by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols
